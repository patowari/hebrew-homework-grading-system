## üõü Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Command not found: streamlit"**
```bash
pip install streamlit
# or
python3 -m pip install streamlit
```

**"Model not found" error**
- Check your Gemini API key is valid
- Use the "Check Available Models" button in the app
- Some models may not be available in all regions
